## Overview

This replica of Vinted is the guiding thread project carried out during the "Le RÃ©acteur" bootcamp. It allows you to understand the basic structure of an e-commerce site, from the creation of a user to the presentation of offers and payment.

This project manages 11 routes for :

1) user registration and connection.
2) consultation of all offers, or of a specific offer.
3) publication, modification and deletion of a user's offer.
4) Pay for an offer via Stripe.
5) View the user's purchases/sales.
6) Automated e-mail notification of user creation to an administrator.

This project enables images to be uploaded to cloudinary using the express-fileupload and cloudinary packages.
The Stripe API is used for payment management.
The Mailgun.js and form-data APIs are used to send automated e-mails.
An "isAuthenticated" middleware ensures the security of routes requiring connection.
